# File: gpg-agent.conf
# Purpose: Configure GnuPG Agent behavior, including passphrase caching
# and pinentry program selection. This file controls how long GPG 
# will cache your passphrase and which tool is used to prompt for it.
#
# Location: ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
# Documentation: man gpg-agent
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Set the default cache time (in seconds) for passphrases.
# After this time, the passphrase will need to be re-entered.
# Example: 3600 = 1 hour
default-cache-ttl 3600

# Set the maximum cache time (in seconds). Even if a passphrase is 
# used repeatedly, it will not be cached beyond this time.
# Example: 99999999 = effectively unlimited until reboot
max-cache-ttl 99999999

# Specify the pinentry program to use for passphrase entry.
# Options include pinentry-tty, pinentry-curses, pinentry-gnome3, pinentry-mac
# On macOS, this should be pinentry-mac; on Linux desktop environments, 
# pinentry-gnome3 or pinentry-qt is common.
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry

# Enable SSH support (optional). This allows the GPG agent to also 
# function as an SSH authentication agent.
